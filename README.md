# Timer
This is my attempt at making a Timer in C#. I started this project as a way to familiarise myself and practice with C# syntax.
Although I am aware of a pre-existing Timer class that can be used to recreate what I have done, I wanted to challenge myself by attempting to build a
timer myself from scratch, building on top of seconds to create minutes, and building on top of seconds and minutes to create hours.

New commands learned during the project
-------------------------------------------
* Console.SetWindowSize() - Sets the height and width of the console window to the specified values
* Thread.Sleep() - Suspends the current thread for the specified amount of time

Improvements to be made
-------------------------------------------
* During the intial start up of the program, it asks the user to set a time, this input is not centered.
* Code could be refactored to improve efficiency and overall readability, specifically the Hour.cs file.
* Comments should be added to all custom methods to explain code and improve readability.
